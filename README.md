## Social App - GraphQL Version
The **+social-app-graphql** branch of the Social App project is an alternate version of the application that uses **!GraphQL** as its API layer. This branch is designed to showcase the benefits of using GraphQL over a traditional REST API.

# Technologies
The server is built using **Node.js and Express.js with the Apollo Server library for GraphQL implementation**. The client-side of the application is built with **React.js and Apollo Client** library for GraphQL.

# Benefits of GraphQL
By using GraphQL, the application benefits from reduced network requests and over-fetching of data, as the client can query exactly what it needs from the server. The GraphQL schema also provides a clear and comprehensive description of the available data and operations.

# Conclusion
Overall, the social-app-graphql branch provides an example of how GraphQL can be used to create a more efficient and flexible API layer for modern web applications.
