## <span style="color:blue">Social App - GraphQL Version</span>

The <strong><span style="color:green">social-app-graphql</span></strong> branch of the Social App project is an alternate version of the application that uses <strong><span style="color:brown">GraphQL</span></strong> as its API layer. This branch is designed to showcase the benefits of using GraphQL over a traditional REST API.

# <span style="color:blue">Technologies</span>

The server is built using <strong><span style="color:green">Node.js and Express.js with the Apollo Server library for GraphQL implementation</span></strong>. The client-side of the application is built with <strong><span style="color:green">React.js and Apollo Client</span></strong> library for GraphQL.

# <span style="color:blue">Benefits of GraphQL</span>

By using GraphQL, the application benefits from reduced network requests and over-fetching of data, as the client can query exactly what it needs from the server. The GraphQL schema also provides a clear and comprehensive description of the available data and operations.

# <span style="color:blue">Conclusion</span>

Overall, the social-app-graphql branch provides an example of how GraphQL can be used to create a more efficient and flexible API layer for modern web applications.
